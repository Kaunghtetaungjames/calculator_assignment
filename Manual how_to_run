Calculator Manual

The Calculator is a simple Python program designed to evaluate arithmetic expressions, convert expressions to prefix or postfix notation, and provide additional information about the calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+) and multiplication (*).

Features:
- Evaluation of arithmetic expressions in infix notation.
- Conversion of expressions to prefix and postfix notation.
- Display of additional information about the calculator.

3. How to Run:
Requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.

Steps:
1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.
2. Copy the provided Python code.

8. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to perform calculations, convert expressions, or get more information about the calculator.
9. To quit the program, enter "quit" when prompted for input and press Enter.

Options:
- calculate: Enter an arithmetic expression in infix notation to evaluate it.
- prefix: Convert an arithmetic expression in infix notation to prefix notation.
- postfix: Convert an arithmetic expression in infix notation to postfix notation.
- info: Display additional information about the calculator and its features.
- quit: Exit the program.

 Examples:
- To evaluate an expression, type "calculate" and enter the expression when prompted.
- To convert an expression to prefix notation, type "prefix" and enter the expression when prompted.
- To convert an expression to postfix notation, type "postfix" and enter the expression when prompted.
- To display information about the calculator, type "info".
- To quit the program, type "quit".

Note: The calculator currently supports only basic arithmetic operations (+ and *). Ensure that the expressions you input follow proper infix notation rules.
